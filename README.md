# dotfiles_2022

Used [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage dotfiles.

## Nvim
- Package manager: [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#quickstart)
- After installing the package manager you might need to uncomment rows in the init.lua in order to get the plugins first installed then you can uncomment them back
